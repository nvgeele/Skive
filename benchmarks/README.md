All of the following benchmark results were produced on a machine
running GNU/Linux (CentOS 6.5), with 2 Intel Xeon E5-2620 CPUs and 64
GB of DDR3-RAM. The "guided self scheduling" option (-gss) was used
and execution was timed using the standard gnu `time` tool.

The hostname of this machine is "lucifer", hence the use of this
name in the results.
