{"name":"Skive","tagline":"A parallel, single assignment Scheme","body":"# Skive\r\nSkive is a parallel, compiled Scheme dialect with single assignment\r\nsemantics, implemented in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/) on the\r\n[SISAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SISAL) platform.\r\n\r\nThe language was designed and implemented for the final bachelor's\r\nproject of Nils Van Geele at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.\r\n\r\nDetails on the rationale behind the language can be found in the\r\n[literature study](http://skive.nvgeele.be/litstudy.pdf). Details\r\non the implementation, benchmarks, installation instructions, and\r\nso forth can be found in the\r\n[final thesis](http://skive.nvgeele.be/thesis.pdf).\r\n\r\n## Directory Structure\r\n* **src** contains the source files of the compiler and Racket\r\n  integration layer\r\n* **tests** contains all tests\r\n* **examples** contains some Skive and Racket integration examples\r\n* **benchmarks** contains Skive and SISAL code use for benchmarks, as\r\n  well as the benchmark results and accompanying Mathenatica notebook\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\nThe latest version of the SISAL compiler and runtime are available\r\non the [SISAL site](http://sisal.sourceforge.net/). The version\r\nused for development is 14.1, is mirrored\r\n[here](http://skive.nvgeele.be/sisal-14.1.0.tgz).\r\n\r\nVersion 13 of the Optimizing SISAL Compiler, including many SISAL\r\ncode examples, the SISAL reference manual, and other documents\r\nare also available [here](http://skive.nvgeele.be/osc-13.0.4.tgz).\r\n\r\nThe \"IF1: An Intermediate Form for Applicative Languages.\" paper by\r\nSkedzielewski and Glauert, containing valuable information on IF1,\r\nis made available [here](http://skive.nvgeele.be/if1.pdf). Other\r\ndocuments on SISAL are freely available on the internet.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
